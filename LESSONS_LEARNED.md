# Lessons Learned

> This file is maintained by AI agents working on this project.
> It captures validated, reusable insights discovered during development.
> **Read this file at the start of every task. Update it at the end of every iteration.**

## How to Use This File

### Reading (Start of Every Task)
Before starting any work, read this file to avoid repeating known mistakes
and to leverage proven approaches.

### Writing (End of Every Iteration)
After completing a task or iteration, evaluate whether any new insight was
gained that would be valuable for future sessions. If yes, add it to the
appropriate category below.

### Promotion from Iteration Log
Patterns that appear 2+ times in `ITERATION_LOG.md` should be promoted
here as a validated lesson.

### Pruning
If a lesson becomes obsolete (e.g., a dependency was removed, an API changed),
move it to the Archive section at the bottom with a date and reason.
